# HeightLimitApp
 A desktop application built for all systems. The idea of bringing [HeightLimitMod](https://github.com/pinkulu/HeightLimitMod) to all the clients from lunar to BLC.
 
## To Do:
 - [ ] Make the UI (working on)
 - [ ] A way to read the chat file
 - [ ] Main page
 - [ ] Current Map page
 - [ ] All Maps Page
 - [ ] Stats page maybe?
 - [ ] Settings page

These are the prioritys right now, but there will be more things added as the list completes

I will be working on these things, but if anyone wants to contribute i would really appriciate it
